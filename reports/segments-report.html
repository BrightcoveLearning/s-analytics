<p>It takes a few minutes to create the segment. The status changes to <strong>In progress</strong> . When the segment is created, you will receive a notification on the screen. Once it has been created, you can see <strong>active</strong> or <strong>Inactive</strong> status.</p>
</li>
<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Notes:
  <ul>
    <li>Editing new filters will override any reports generated with the previous filters </li>
  <li>The Segment IDs are unique to each segment and allow you to identify each segment</li>
  <li>The time it takes to create a segment could vary depending on the size of segment being generated. You will see a notification, when the segment is created. You can also click the refresh button to get the latest status</li>
  <li>A user can be associated with multiple Segment IDs , and will have each of these segment IDs tagged to user records that can be synchronized with CRM or MAP systems, or be downloaded as a report</li>
  <li>Creating a segment is not dependent on establishing integrations with MAP/CRM Systems. Segments can be created and downloaded as a report</li>
  <li>Once you create a segment and set it to <strong>active</strong> status, it automatically updates your integrations. However, you can still use segments without having to use those integrations. So you do not need to establish the integrations to the account. You would still be available to create segments and download reports</li>
<li>There is a limit of 10 active segments allowed at a time. If you need to create more segments, set one of the segments to <strong>inactive</strong> to create a new segment</li>
<li>Once a report is generated, you will have Seven days to view it before it is deleted. The segment will remain active, however, the latest report needs to be regenerated.</li>
