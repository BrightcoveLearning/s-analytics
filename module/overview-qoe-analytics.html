    <p>Quality of Experience (QoE) analytics provide information to help understand the user's video streaming experience, including playback success, startup time, rebuffering, and visual quality. </p>
    <p>QoE Analytics provide Brightcove customers with a transparent, meaningful, and well-curated set of metrics focused on the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Troubleshooting</strong>: What errors are viewers experiencing? Are errors related to the player, CDN, or encoding? Can I mitigate these errors?</li>
      <li><strong>Reporting</strong>: How is my service performing across key QoE metrics? Are there trends that I should be aware of and address?</li>
      <li><strong>Monitoring</strong>: Tracking near real-time metrics that show how viewers are impacted.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can aggregate and filter on the following QoE metrics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Account (provides overall number)</li>
      <li>Device</li>
      <li>Domanin and subdomain</li>
      <li>Stream type (VOD)</li>
      <li>Player</li>
      <li>Country</li>
      <li>Day</li>
    </ul>

      <p>If you assign a TVOD plan to a Series, viewers will be able to purchase or rent that Series. If they buy the Series, viewers will also get new seasons and episodes when they are added to that Series.</p>
      If you want viewers to pay for each new episode, consider assigning the TVOD plan at the episode level.
