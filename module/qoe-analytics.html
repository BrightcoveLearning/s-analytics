    <p>Quality of Experience (QoE) analytics provide information to help understand the user's video streaming experience, including playback success, startup time, rebuffering, and visual quality. </p>
    <p>QoE Analytics provide Brightcove customers with a transparent, meaningful, and well-curated set of metrics focused on the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Troubleshooting</strong>: What errors are viewers experiencing? Are errors related to the player, CDN, or encoding? Can I mitigate these errors?</li>
      <li><strong>Reporting</strong>: How is my service performing across key QoE metrics? Are there trends that I should be aware of and address?</li>
      <li><strong>Monitoring</strong>: Tracking near real-time metrics that show how viewers are impacted.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can aggregate and filter on the following QoE metrics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Account (provides overall number)</li>
      <li>Device</li>
      <li>Domanin and subdomain</li>
      <li>Stream type (VOD)</li>
      <li>Player</li>
      <li>Country</li>
      <li>Day</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="Terms">Terms</h2>
    <p>The following terms relate to QoE analytics metrics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Average Video Bitrate</strong> - the average bitrate played in the player weighted by the duration it was watched</li>
      <li><strong>Error count</strong> - Number of the errors that prevent or interrupt playback or that could impact start/resume time</li>
      <li><strong>Error rate</strong> - Number of errors that prevent or interrupt playback or that could impact start/resume time divided by the video views for the selected time interval</li>
      <li><strong>Rebuffering Time</strong> - Seconds spent rebuffering per hour of watched video</li>
      <li><strong>Stalls</strong> - Alternative to rebuffering; total number of stalls divided by the sum of the watch time</li>

      <li><strong>Video Resolution</strong> (avg min per hour) - Average minutes watched per hour of viewing, by categories of video resolution (using the height of the video in pixels); weighted by the time watched at that resolution</li>
      <li><strong>Video start time</strong> - Average time between the play request and the stream start per video view; this time does not include ad pre-roll time; <strong>start time</strong> looks to describe how much time the viewer had to wait before video started to play</li>
      <li><strong>Video Views</strong> - The number of times a video started playing, recorded when the stream is started (does not include rewind or replay); it is not a measure of individual viewers</li>
      
      
    </ul>
