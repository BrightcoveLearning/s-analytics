    <p>Quality of Experience (QoE) analytics provide information to help understand the user's video streaming experience, including playback success, startup time, rebuffering, and visual quality. </p>
    <p>QoE Analytics provide Brightcove customers with a transparent, meaningful, and well-curated set of metrics focused on the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Troubleshooting</strong>: What errors are viewers experiencing? Are errors related to the player, CDN, or encoding? Can I mitigate these errors?</li>
      <li><strong>Reporting</strong>: How is my service performing across key QoE metrics? Are there trends that I should be aware of and address?</li>
      <li><strong>Monitoring</strong>: Tracking near real-time metrics that show how viewers are impacted.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following charts trend over time, at a daily or hourly interval (depending on time range). When you select a dimension, it will be reflected in all of the charts.</p>
   
    <h3>Error rate</h3>
    <p>The error rate is the number of errors divided by the number of play requests. The error count includes all error types.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Error rate" src="/assets/images/s-analytics-img/module/qoe/error-rate.webp" />
      <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Error rate</figcaption> 
    </figure>

    <h3>Video start time</h3>
    <p>The video start time is the average time betweenn play request and stream start.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Video start time" src="/assets/images/s-analytics-img/module/qoe/video-start-time.webp" />
      <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">EVideo start time</figcaption> 
    </figure>

    <h3>Stall rate</h3>
    <p>The stall rate is the total number of stalls divided by the total number of hours streamed.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Stall rate" src="/assets/images/s-analytics-img/module/qoe/stall-rate.webp" />
      <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Stall rate</figcaption> 
    </figure>

    <h3>Upscale time</h3>
    <p>The upscale time is the average number of seconds per hour of viewing that is spent in an upscaled state (seconds per hour).</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Upscale time" src="/assets/images/s-analytics-img/module/qoe/upscale-time.webp" />

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Summary table">Summary table</h2>
    <p>The date range and dimensions that you set for the page, also applies to the data in the summary table. For example, if you select the <strong>Device</strong> dimension, you will see a <strong>Summary by Device</strong>.</p>
    <h3>Summary by Device</h3>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Summary by Device" src="/assets/images/s-analytics-img/module/qoe/summary-by-device.webp" />
      <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Summary by Device</figcaption> 
    </figure>
    <p>Each column is sortable. The default sort order is video views descending.</p>
    <p>Column data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Views</strong> - The number of times a video started playing, recorded when the stream is started (does not include rewind or replay); it is not a measure of individual viewers</li>
      <li><strong>Error count</strong> - Number of the errors that prevent or interrupt playback or that could impact start/resume time </li>
      <li><strong>Error rate</strong> - Number of errors that prevent or interrupt playback or that could impact start/resume time divided by the video views for the selected time interval</li>
      <li><strong>Video start time</strong> - Average time between the play request and the stream start per video view; this time does not include ad pre-roll time; <strong>start time</strong> looks to describe how much time the viewer had to wait before video started to play</li>
      <li><strong>Video resolution</strong> (avg min per hour) - Average minutes watched per hour of viewing, by categories of video resolution (using the height of the video in pixels); weighted by the time watched at that resolution</li>
      <li><strong>Rebuffering time</strong> - Seconds spent rebuffering per hour of watched video</li>
      <li><strong>Stall rate</strong> - Total number of stalls divided by the sum of the watch time</li>
      <li><strong>Bitrate</strong> - the average bitrate played in the player weighted by the duration it was watched</li>
      <li><strong>Rendition switches</strong> - Average number of switches across all sessions</li>
      <li><strong>Upscale factor</strong> -  The ratio between player resolution and delivered video resolution when the player viewport is bigger than the delivered resolution</li>
      <li><strong>Upscale time</strong> - The average number of seconds per hour of viewing that is spent in an upscaled state</li>
    </ul>
