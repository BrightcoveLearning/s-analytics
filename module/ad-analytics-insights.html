    <p>Transactional Video On Demand (TVOD) is a monetization package where viewers can pay a one-time fee to either purchase or rent an OTT asset. A TVOD package can be associated with one asset or a bundle of assets, like a series or season. The viewer can be alloted a certain amount of time to view the asset, or it can be unlimited. </p>
    <p>Unlike SVOD where viewers pay a subscription to access video content, TVOD viewers pay a fee for each piece of content they want to view.</p>
    <p>TVOD packages give the viewers the following options for watching content:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rent</li>
      <li>Buy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To add content to TVOD plans, edit each asset and associate it with applicable plans. The following content types can be used with TVOD packages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Movies</li>
      <li>Series, Seasons, and Episodes</li>
      <li>Live events</li>
      <!-- <li>Channels</li> -->
      <!-- <li>Playlists and Pages</li> -->
      <!-- <li>Programs</li> -->
    </ul>

      <p>If you assign a TVOD plan to a Series, viewers will be able to purchase or rent that Series. If they buy the Series, viewers will also get new seasons and episodes when they are added to that Series.</p>
      If you want viewers to pay for each new episode, consider assigning the TVOD plan at the episode level.
