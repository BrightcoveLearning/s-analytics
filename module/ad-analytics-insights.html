    <p>Ad analytics is a free-of-charge offering to enable the Brightcove platform with a transparent, meaningful, and comprehensive set of ad metrics.</p>
    <p>Ad analytics incorporates data from the SSAI system and a client-side plugin measuring viewability and CSAI data. Data integrations will be phased, starting with SSAI VOD, followed by SSAI live/linear, and finally, client-side data. These metrics will focus on the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> <strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> What ad configurations and partners are serving ads more efficiently? What are the technical errors preventing ad impressions?</li>
      <li> <strong>Reporting/Impact:</strong> Tracking Ad Impressions, fill rate, and how the audience consumes the impressions. What are the impact of ad blockers and firewalls on your ad operation?</li>
    </ul>
