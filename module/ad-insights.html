    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Quality of Experience (QoE) analytics provide information to help understand the user's video streaming experience, including playback success, startup time, rebuffering, and visual quality. </p>
    <p>QoE focuses on metrics that provide a sense of the viewing experience from a user's perspective. It is Brightcove's goal to provide customers with a transparent, meaningful, and well-curated set of metrics focused on the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>:   
        <ul>
          <!-- <li>What nuances are viewers experiencing?</li> -->
          <li>Which devices and players have a lower quality of experience?</li>
          <li>Are issues related to the player, device, or geographic region?</li>
          <li>Can I mitigate these issues?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reporting</strong>: 
        <ul>
          <li>How is my service performing across key QoE metrics?</li>
          <li>Are there trends that I should be aware of and address?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Monitoring</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>You can track video metrics that show how viewers are impacted.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>For a list of QoE terms and definitions, see the <a href="#Glossary">Glossary</a> section.</p>

        <!-- <h4><strong>Account</strong></h4>
        <p>The Account view provides an overall number for all streams in your account across all platforms.</p>

        <p>The Device type view makes it easier to see device-specific issues and trends over time. The imaginary example below shows a spike in error rate for Android devices that could correlate to a recent app update.</p>

    <h2 id="Error_rate">Error rate</h2>
    <p>The error rate is the number of errors reported by the player divided by the number of play requests.</p>
    <!-- <p>Brightcove Player reports errors that prevent video playback. These errors often happen before playback begins. Low error rates mean that viewers can watch their selected content.</p> -->
    <p>Here we focus on the errors that prevent playback since some errors occur in the background without affecting the viewer experience. Brightcove Player reports errors that prevent video playback, but some of these errors happen before playback begins. Low error rates mean that viewers can watch their selected content.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Error rate cannot be broken down by Stream type. The chart below shows account-level data.</aside>

    <h2 id="Summary table">Summary table</h2>
    <p>The summary table makes it easy to explore and identify anomalies.</p>
    <p>The date range and dimensions that you set for the page, also applies to the data in the summary table. For example, if you select the <strong>Device</strong> dimension, you will see a <strong>Summary by Device</strong>.</p>
    <h3>Summary by Device</h3>

    <p>Each column is sortable. The default sort order is video views descending.</p>
    <p>In addition to the key metrics, the summary table includes the following data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>View count</li>
      <li>Video resolution breakdown</li>
      <li>Rebuffering time</li>
      <li>Avg Bitrate</li>
    </ul>

  </section> -->

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Glossary">Glossary</h2>
    <h4>B</h4>
    <p><strong>Bitrate</strong> - The average bitrate reported by the player accross all sessions in a given period</p>
    <h4>E</h4>
    <!-- <p><strong>Error count</strong> - Number of the errors that prevent or interrupt playback or that could impact start/resume time </p> -->
    <p><strong>Error rate</strong> - Number of errors that prevent or interrupt playback or that could impact start/resume time divided by the video views for the selected time interval</p>
    <h4>P</h4>
    <p><strong>Play request</strong> - A play request is counted every time the play button is clicked</p>
    <h4>R</h4>
    <p><strong>Rebuffering time</strong> - Seconds spent rebuffering per hour of watched video</p>
    <!-- <p><strong>Rendition switches</strong> - Average number of switches across all sessions</p> -->
    <h4>S</h4>
    <p><strong>Stall rate</strong> - Total number of stalls divided by the sum of the watch time</p>
    <h4>U</h4>
    <!-- <p><strong>Upscale factor</strong> -  The ratio between player resolution and delivered video resolution when the player viewport is bigger than the delivered resolution</p> -->
    <p><strong>Upscale time</strong> - The average number of seconds per hour of viewing that is spent in an upscaled state; upscaling occurs when a video rendition is streamed in a lower resolution than the current player size</p>
    <h4>V</h4>
    <p><strong>Video resolution</strong> (avg min per hour) - Average minutes watched per hour of viewing, by categories of video resolution (using the height of the video in pixels); weighted by the time watched at that resolution</p>
    <p><strong>Video start time</strong> - Average time between the play request and the stream start per video view; this time does not include ad pre-roll time; start time looks to describe how much time the viewer had to wait before video started to play</p>
    <p><strong>Views</strong> - The number of times a video started playing, recorded when the stream is started (does not include rewind or replay); it is not a measure of individual viewers</p>
