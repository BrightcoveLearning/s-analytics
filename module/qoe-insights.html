    <p>Quality of Experience (QoE) Insights incorporate QoE analytics data and user engagement data to allow you to track and determine your audience's QoE tolerance and abandonment factors. These insights lead to actionable steps to improve user experience.</p>

    <p>QoE insights provide Brightcove customers with easy-to-understand correlations from QoE Metrics, potential business impacts, and recommended interventions. These insights are categorized as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>QoE Tolerance</strong>:   
        <ul>
          <li>Help you understand when QoE metrics have an impact on user engagement</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>QoE Benchmarks</strong>: 
        <ul>

    <p>Once your account is enabled for QoE Insights, you will find them in the Analytics module in Studio.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>Open Video Cloud Studio.</li>
      <li>In the primary navigation, click <strong>Analytics</strong>.</li>
      <li>
        <p>In the panel navigation, click <strong>QOE</strong>. At the top, you will see a <strong>Quality Score</strong> for your account. This feature is a part of QoE Insights </p>
        <p>The Quality Score provides a quick reference for the user experience related to video playback.</p>

    <h2 id="Quality_Score">Quality Score</h2>
    <p>The Quality Score is a quick way to view customer engagement. The score is based on correlations between video playback and viewer dropoff. The colors indicate the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Green</strong> - Everything looks good</li>
      <li><strong>Yellow</strong> - Areas to watch</li>
      <li><strong>Red</strong> - Action may be taken to improve</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Error rate cannot be broken down by Stream type.</aside> -->

      <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Quality score</figcaption> 
    </figure>

    <p>Metrics are weighted to calculate the Quality Score:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash" translate="No">Quality Score = Video start time / 50
              + Rebuffering per min / 30
              + Upscale duration / 20
              - Percentage error rate

    <h2 id="Video_start_time">Video start time</h2>
    <p>This chart shows the correlation between video start time and abandonment rate. The chart lets you see the point at which video start times lead to high abandonment rates.</p>
    <p>The video start time is the average time between play request and stream start. Another way to think about it is the time from when the viewer first clicks the play button and the first frame of video playback.</p>
    <p>Abandonment is when a viewer leaves before the first frame of the video plays. </p>
    <!-- <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Video start time does not consider pre-roll time.</aside> -->
    <p>This example shows the top 5 devices by view count overlayed with the average abandonment rate.</p>

    <h2 id="Engagement_Funnel">Engagement Funnel</h2>
    <p>The Engagement Funnel shows viewer engagement through various stages of video consumption. The funnel shows viewer engagement (those watching and those lost) from the play request to video view through the point of 75% video completion. The funnel lets you visualize the magnitude of lost viewers for the chosen dimension. </p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Engagement Funnel" src="/assets/images/s-analytics-img/module/qoe-insights/engagement-funnel.webp" />

    </figure>
    <h3>Metric</h3>
    <p>The Metric selector lets you control the buckets, which define how the data is grouped.</p>
    <p>The example below has the Rebuffer metric selected. The colors in the funnel shows the rebuffering rate for each group:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>5+ minutes</li>
      <li>30 seconds to 5 minutes</li>
      <li>5 to 30 seconds</li>
      <li>Less than 5 seconds</li>
      <li>Number of errors</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you look at the Rebuffer metric and viewer drop-off is large, you can look at the bitrate you are using and adjust it to minimize buffering.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Rebuffer metric" src="/assets/images/s-analytics-img/module/qoe-insights/rebuffer-funnel.webp" />
    </figure>
    <h4>Group by</h4>
    <p>Another way to look at the data is to group by the selected metric.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Group by metric" src="/assets/images/s-analytics-img/module/qoe-insights/group-by-metric.webp" />

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Completion_Rate">Completion Rate</h2>
    <p>The Completion Rate charts show what happens over time to viewers once they are watching a video. When video start time is high, most viewers will drop off.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Completion Rate" src="/assets/images/s-analytics-img/module/qoe-insights/completion-rate.webp" />
      <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Completion Rate</figcaption>

    <h3>Dimension</h3>
    <p>Click <strong>Video start time</strong> to expand the Completion Rate dimension dropdown menu. Select a dimension to change the data displayed.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Video start dimension" src="/assets/images/s-analytics-img/module/qoe-insights/completion-dimension.webp" />
    </figure>
    <h3>Completion Rate example</h3>
    <p>With <strong>Rebuffering time</strong> selected, we see that most viewers decide to continue watching within the first 20 percent of the video length.</p>
    <p>Most viewers (97%) continue watching when the re-buffering time is less than 5 seconds.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Completion Rate example" src="/assets/images/s-analytics-img/module/qoe-insights/completion-rate-example.webp" />
    </figure>
    <h3>Interest Phase</h3>
    <p>The bar graph shows when viewers have the highest risk of dropping off the video. Here we can see that video views drop significantly when the video start time is more than 6 seconds.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Interest Phase" src="/assets/images/s-analytics-img/module/qoe-insights/interest-phase.webp" />
    </figure>
    <h3>Completion details</h3>
    <p>The completion details allow you to dig into what is happening within a metric time period. This example shows the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When the re-buffer rate is between 1 and 5 minutes, only 14.1% of viewers watch at least 75% of the video length (considered complete)</li>
      <li>There are 76.6K total views</li>
      <li>Average error rate is 6.9%</li>
      <li>Average stall rate is 12.5/hr</li>
      <li>Upscale time is 3.7min/hr</li>
      <li>Top views by country, device, and content duration</li>
    </ul>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Completion details" src="/assets/images/s-analytics-img/module/qoe-insights/completion-details.webp" />
    </figure>

    <h2 id="Glossary">Glossary</h2>
    <h4>B</h4>
    <p><strong>Bitrate</strong> - The average bitrate reported by the player accross all sessions in a given period</p>
    <h4>E</h4>
    <p><strong>Error rate</strong> - Number of errors that prevent or interrupt playback or that could impact start/resume time divided by the video views for the selected time interval</p>
    <h4>P</h4>
    <p><strong>Play request</strong> - A play request is counted every time the play button is clicked</p>
    <h4>R</h4>
    <p><strong>Rebuffering time</strong> - Seconds spent rebuffering per hour of watched video</p>
    <h4>S</h4>
    <p><strong>Stall rate</strong> - Total number of stalls divided by the sum of the watch time</p>
    <h4>U</h4>
    <p><strong>Upscale time</strong> - The average number of seconds per hour of viewing that is spent in an upscaled state; upscaling occurs when a video rendition is streamed in a lower resolution than the current player size</p>
    <h4>V</h4>
    <p><strong>Video resolution</strong> (avg min per hour) - Average minutes watched per hour of viewing, by categories of video resolution (using the height of the video in pixels); weighted by the time watched at that resolution</p>
    <p><strong>Video start time</strong> - Average time between the play request and the stream start per video view; this time does not include ad pre-roll time; start time looks to describe how much time the viewer had to wait before video started to play</p>
    <p><strong>Views</strong> - The number of times a video started playing, recorded when the stream is started (does not include rewind or replay); it is not a measure of individual viewers</p>
