    <h2 id="Quality_Score">Quality Score</h2>
    <p>The Quality Score is a quick way to view customer engagement. The score is based on correlations between video playback and viewer dropoff. The colors indicate the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Green</strong> - Everything looks good</li>
      <li><strong>Yellow</strong> - Areas to watch</li>
      <li><strong>Red</strong> - Action may be taken to improve</li>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Error_rate">Error rate</h2>
    <p>The error rate is the number of errors reported by the player divided by the number of play requests.</p>
    <p>Here we focus on the errors that prevent playback since some errors occur in the background without affecting the viewer experience. Brightcove Player reports errors that prevent video playback, but some of these errors happen before playback begins. Low error rates mean that viewers can watch their selected content.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Video_start_time">Video start time</h2>
    <p>The video start time is the average time between play request and stream start.</p>
    <p>This metric is helpful because long load times cause abandonment before streaming starts. Long load times can point to issues with CDN, player plug-ins, and initial stream bitrate where intervention makes sense. Low video start times mean your viewers can start watching their videos quickly, which is what they expect.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Video start time does not consider pre-roll time.</aside>
    <p>This example shows the top 5 devices by view count, and the account level.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Stall_rate">Stall rate</h2>
    <p>The stall rate is the total number of stalls divided by the total number of hours streamed.</p>
    <p>We focus on actual video stalls instead of all rebuffering events because rebuffering may or may not impact playback, depending on the platform. Stalls affect the viewer experience, including single stalls of significant length or frequent stalls of varying lengths. Low stall rates provide smoother playback and a better viewer experience.</p>
    <p>This example shows the top 5 devices by view count, and the account level.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Stall rate" src="/assets/images/s-analytics-img/module/qoe/stall-rate.webp" />

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Upscale_time">Upscale time</h2>
    <p>The upscale time is the average number of seconds per hour of viewing that is spent in an upscaled state (seconds per hour).</p>
    <p>Upscaling occurs when a video rendition is streamed in a lower resolution than the current player size. Upscaling can result in fuzziness or video pixelation. One area where upscaling is common is when content is streamed to a 4K TV. In this case, the stream may be available at a high resolution but not encoded at 4k. While technically, this is upscaling, most viewers will not notice. Low upscaling time is associated with smooth, crisp video playback.</p>
    <p>This example shows the top 5 countries by view count, and the account level.</p>

    <h2 id="Summary table">Summary table</h2>
    <p>The summary table makes it easy to explore and identify anomalies.</p>
    <p>The date range and dimensions that you set for the page, also applies to the data in the summary table. For example, if you select the <strong>Device</strong> dimension, you will see a <strong>Summary by Device</strong>.</p>
    <h3>Summary by Device</h3>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Summary by Device" src="/assets/images/s-analytics-img/module/qoe/summary-by-device.webp" />
      <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Summary by Device</figcaption> 
    </figure>
    <p>Each column is sortable. The default sort order is video views descending.</p>
    <p>In addition to the key metrics, the summary table includes the following data:</p>

    <p>This chart shows the correlation between video start time and abandonment rate. The chart lets you see the point at which video start times lead to high abandonment rates.</p>
    <p>The video start time is the average time between play request and stream start. Another way to think about it is the time from when the viewer first clicks the play button and the first frame of video playback.</p>
    <p>Abandonment is when a viewer leaves before the first frame of the video plays. </p>

    <h2 id="Engagement_Funnel">Engagement Funnel</h2>
    <p>The Engagement Funnel shows viewer engagement through various stages of video consumption. The funnel shows viewer engagement (those watching and those lost) from the play request to video view through the point of 75% video completion. The funnel lets you visualize the magnitude of lost viewers for the chosen dimension. </p>

    <h3>Metric</h3>
    <p>The Metric selector lets you control the buckets, which define how the data is grouped.</p>
    <p>The example below has the Rebuffer metric selected. The colors in the funnel shows the rebuffering rate for each group:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>5+ minutes</li>
      <li>30 seconds to 5 minutes</li>
      <li>5 to 30 seconds</li>
      <li>Less than 5 seconds</li>
      <li>Number of errors</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you look at the Rebuffer metric and viewer drop-off is large, you can look at the bitrate you are using and adjust it to minimize buffering.</p>

    </figure>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>In this example, with <strong>Rebuffering time</strong> selected, we see that most viewers decide to continue watching within the first 20 percent of the video length. Also, most viewers (97%) continue watching when the rebuffering time is less than 5 seconds.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Completion Rate example" src="/assets/images/s-analytics-img/module/qoe-insights/completion-rate-example.webp" />
    </figure>
    <h3>Interest Phase</h3>
    <p>The highlighted area in the graph shows that the highest abandonment rate happens within the first 20% of the video. Knowing this, you can be intelligent with your ad strategy during this timeframe. Consider varying the number of ads and the ad length to see how it affects viewer completion.</p>

    <h3>Completion details</h3>
    <p>The completion details allow you to dig into what is happening within a metric time period. This example shows the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When the re-buffer rate is between 1 and 5 minutes, only 14.1% of viewers watch at least 75% of the video length (considered complete)</li>
      <li>There are 76.6K total views</li>
      <li>Average error rate is 6.9%</li>
