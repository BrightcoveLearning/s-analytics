    <p>Quality of Experience (QoE) Insights incorporate QoE analytics data and user engagement data to allow you to track and determine your audience's QoE tolerance and abandonment factors. These insights lead to actionable steps to improve user experience.</p>

    <p>QoE insights provide Brightcove customers with easy-to-understand correlations from QoE Metrics, potential business impacts, and recommended interventions. These insights are categorized as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>QoE Tolerance</strong>:   
        <ul>
          <li>Help you understand when QoE metrics have an impact on user engagement</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>QoE Benchmarks</strong>:

    <p>Once your account is enabled for QoE Insights, you will find them in the Analytics module in Studio.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>Open Video Cloud Studio.</li>
      <li>In the primary navigation, click <strong>Analytics</strong>.</li>

    <h2 id="Quality_Score">Quality Score</h2>
    <p>The Quality Score is a quick way to view customer engagement. The score is based on correlations between video playback and viewer dropoff. The colors indicate the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Green</strong> - Everything looks good</li>
      <li><strong>Yellow</strong> - Areas to watch</li>
      <li><strong>Red</strong> - Action may be taken to improve</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Error rate cannot be broken down by Stream type.</aside> -->

    <p>Metrics are weighted to calculate the Quality Score:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash" translate="No">Quality Score = Video start time / 50
              + Rebuffering per min / 30
              + Upscale duration / 20
              - Percentage error rate

    <h2 id="Video_start_time">Video start time</h2>
    <p>This chart shows the correlation between video start time and abandonment rate. The chart lets you see the point at which video start times lead to high abandonment rates.</p>
    <p>The video start time is the average time between play request and stream start. Another way to think about it is the time from when the viewer first clicks the play button and the first frame of video playback.</p>
    <p>Abandonment is when a viewer leaves before the first frame of the video plays. </p>
    <!-- <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Video start time does not consider pre-roll time.</aside> -->
    <p>This example shows the top 5 devices by view count overlayed with the average abandonment rate.</p>

    <h2 id="Engagement_Funnel">Engagement Funnel</h2>
    <p>The Engagement Funnel shows viewer engagement through various stages of video consumption. The funnel shows viewer engagement (those watching and those lost) from the play request to video view through the point of 75% video completion. The funnel lets you visualize the magnitude of lost viewers for the chosen dimension. </p>

    <h2 id="Stall_rate">Stall rate</h2>
    <p>The stall rate is the total number of stalls divided by the total number of hours streamed.</p>
    <p>We focus on actual video stalls instead of all rebuffering events because rebuffering may or may not impact playback, depending on the platform. Stalls affect the viewer experience, including single stalls of significant length or frequent stalls of varying lengths. Low stall rates provide smoother playback and a better viewer experience.</p>
    <p>This example shows the top 5 devices by view count, and the account level.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Stall rate" src="/assets/images/s-analytics-img/module/qoe/stall-rate.webp" />

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Upscale_time">Upscale time</h2>
    <p>The upscale time is the average number of seconds per hour of viewing that is spent in an upscaled state (seconds per hour).</p>
    <p>Upscaling occurs when a video rendition is streamed in a lower resolution than the current player size. Upscaling can result in fuzziness or video pixelation. One area where upscaling is common is when content is streamed to a 4K TV. In this case, the stream may be available at a high resolution but not encoded at 4k. While technically, this is upscaling, most viewers will not notice. Low upscaling time is associated with smooth, crisp video playback.</p>
    <p>This example shows the top 5 countries by view count, and the account level.</p>

    <h2 id="Summary table">Summary table</h2>
    <p>The summary table makes it easy to explore and identify anomalies.</p>
    <p>The date range and dimensions that you set for the page, also applies to the data in the summary table. For example, if you select the <strong>Device</strong> dimension, you will see a <strong>Summary by Device</strong>.</p>
    <h3>Summary by Device</h3>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Summary by Device" src="/assets/images/s-analytics-img/module/qoe/summary-by-device.webp" />
      <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Summary by Device</figcaption> 
    </figure>
    <p>Each column is sortable. The default sort order is video views descending.</p>
    <p>In addition to the key metrics, the summary table includes the following data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>View count</li>
      <li>Video resolution breakdown</li>
      <li>Rebuffering time</li>
      <li>Avg Bitrate</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For details about the column data, see the <a href="#Glossary">Glossary</a> below.</p>
  </section> -->

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Glossary">Glossary</h2>
    <h4>B</h4>
    <p><strong>Bitrate</strong> - The average bitrate reported by the player accross all sessions in a given period</p>
    <h4>E</h4>
    <p><strong>Error rate</strong> - Number of errors that prevent or interrupt playback or that could impact start/resume time divided by the video views for the selected time interval</p>
    <h4>P</h4>
    <p><strong>Play request</strong> - A play request is counted every time the play button is clicked</p>
    <h4>R</h4>
    <p><strong>Rebuffering time</strong> - Seconds spent rebuffering per hour of watched video</p>
    <h4>S</h4>
    <p><strong>Stall rate</strong> - Total number of stalls divided by the sum of the watch time</p>
    <h4>U</h4>
    <p><strong>Upscale time</strong> - The average number of seconds per hour of viewing that is spent in an upscaled state; upscaling occurs when a video rendition is streamed in a lower resolution than the current player size</p>
    <h4>V</h4>
    <p><strong>Video resolution</strong> (avg min per hour) - Average minutes watched per hour of viewing, by categories of video resolution (using the height of the video in pixels); weighted by the time watched at that resolution</p>
    <p><strong>Video start time</strong> - Average time between the play request and the stream start per video view; this time does not include ad pre-roll time; start time looks to describe how much time the viewer had to wait before video started to play</p>
    <p><strong>Views</strong> - The number of times a video started playing, recorded when the stream is started (does not include rewind or replay); it is not a measure of individual viewers</p>
