    <p>Once your account is enabled for QoE Insights, you will find them in the Analytics module in Studio.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>Open Video Cloud Studio.</li>
      <li>In the primary navigation, click <strong>Analytics</strong>.</li>
      <li>
        <p>In the panel navigation, click <strong>QOE</strong>. At the top, you will see a <strong>Quality Score</strong> for your account. This feature is a part of QoE Insights </p>
        <p>The Quality Score provides a quick reference for the user experience related to video playback.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Quality_Score">Quality Score</h2>
    <p>The error rate is the number of errors reported by the player divided by the number of play requests.</p>
    <p>Here we focus on the errors that prevent playback since some errors occur in the background without affecting the viewer experience. Brightcove Player reports errors that prevent video playback, but some of these errors happen before playback begins. Low error rates mean that viewers can watch their selected content.</p>
    <!-- <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Error rate cannot be broken down by Stream type.</aside> -->
    <p>This example shows the top 5 devices by view count, and the account level.</p>

  <!-- <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Video_start_time">Video start time</h2>
    <p>The video start time is the average time between play request and stream start.</p>
    <p>This metric is helpful because long load times cause abandonment before streaming starts. Long load times can point to issues with CDN, player plug-ins, and initial stream bitrate where intervention makes sense. Low video start times mean your viewers can start watching their videos quickly, which is what they expect.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Video start time does not consider pre-roll time.</aside>
    <p>This example shows the top 5 devices by view count, and the account level.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Stall_rate">Stall rate</h2>
    <p>The stall rate is the total number of stalls divided by the total number of hours streamed.</p>
    <p>We focus on actual video stalls instead of all rebuffering events because rebuffering may or may not impact playback, depending on the platform. Stalls affect the viewer experience, including single stalls of significant length or frequent stalls of varying lengths. Low stall rates provide smoother playback and a better viewer experience.</p>
    <p>This example shows the top 5 devices by view count, and the account level.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Stall rate" src="/assets/images/s-analytics-img/module/qoe/stall-rate.webp" />

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Upscale_time">Upscale time</h2>
    <p>The upscale time is the average number of seconds per hour of viewing that is spent in an upscaled state (seconds per hour).</p>
    <p>Upscaling occurs when a video rendition is streamed in a lower resolution than the current player size. Upscaling can result in fuzziness or video pixelation. One area where upscaling is common is when content is streamed to a 4K TV. In this case, the stream may be available at a high resolution but not encoded at 4k. While technically, this is upscaling, most viewers will not notice. Low upscaling time is associated with smooth, crisp video playback.</p>
    <p>This example shows the top 5 countries by view count, and the account level.</p>

    <h2 id="Summary table">Summary table</h2>
    <p>The summary table makes it easy to explore and identify anomalies.</p>
    <p>The date range and dimensions that you set for the page, also applies to the data in the summary table. For example, if you select the <strong>Device</strong> dimension, you will see a <strong>Summary by Device</strong>.</p>
    <h3>Summary by Device</h3>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Summary by Device" src="/assets/images/s-analytics-img/module/qoe/summary-by-device.webp" />
      <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Summary by Device</figcaption> 
    </figure>
    <p>Each column is sortable. The default sort order is video views descending.</p>
    <p>In addition to the key metrics, the summary table includes the following data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>View count</li>
      <li>Video resolution breakdown</li>
      <li>Rebuffering time</li>
      <li>Avg Bitrate</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For details about the column data, see the <a href="#Glossary">Glossary</a> below.</p>
  </section> -->

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Glossary">Glossary</h2>
    <h4>B</h4>
    <p><strong>Bitrate</strong> - The average bitrate reported by the player accross all sessions in a given period</p>
    <h4>E</h4>
    <p><strong>Error rate</strong> - Number of errors that prevent or interrupt playback or that could impact start/resume time divided by the video views for the selected time interval</p>
    <h4>P</h4>
    <p><strong>Play request</strong> - A play request is counted every time the play button is clicked</p>
    <h4>R</h4>
    <p><strong>Rebuffering time</strong> - Seconds spent rebuffering per hour of watched video</p>
    <h4>S</h4>
    <p><strong>Stall rate</strong> - Total number of stalls divided by the sum of the watch time</p>
    <h4>U</h4>
    <p><strong>Upscale time</strong> - The average number of seconds per hour of viewing that is spent in an upscaled state; upscaling occurs when a video rendition is streamed in a lower resolution than the current player size</p>
    <h4>V</h4>
    <p><strong>Video resolution</strong> (avg min per hour) - Average minutes watched per hour of viewing, by categories of video resolution (using the height of the video in pixels); weighted by the time watched at that resolution</p>
    <p><strong>Video start time</strong> - Average time between the play request and the stream start per video view; this time does not include ad pre-roll time; start time looks to describe how much time the viewer had to wait before video started to play</p>
    <p><strong>Views</strong> - The number of times a video started playing, recorded when the stream is started (does not include rewind or replay); it is not a measure of individual viewers</p>
