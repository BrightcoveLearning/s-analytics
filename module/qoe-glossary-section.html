  <h4>E</h4>
  <!-- <p><strong>Error count</strong> - Number of the errors that prevent or interrupt playback or that could impact start/resume time </p> -->
  <p><strong>Error rate</strong> - The number of sessions with at least one error divided by the number of play requests</p>
  <h4>P</h4>
  <p><strong>Play request</strong> - A play request is counted every time the play button is clicked</p>
  <h4>R</h4>
  <p><strong>Rebuffering time</strong> - Seconds spent rebuffering per hour of watched video</p>
  <!-- <p><strong>Rendition switches</strong> - Average number of switches across all sessions</p> -->
  <h4>S</h4>
  <p><strong>Stall rate</strong> - Total number of stalls divided by the sum of the watch time</p>
  <h4>U</h4>
  <!-- <p><strong>Upscale factor</strong> -  The ratio between player resolution and delivered video resolution when the player viewport is bigger than the delivered resolution</p> -->
  <p><strong>Upscale time</strong> - The average number of seconds per hour of viewing that is spent in an upscaled state; upscaling occurs when a video rendition is streamed in a lower resolution than the current player size</p>
  <h4>V</h4>
  <p><strong>Video resolution</strong> (avg min per hour) - Average minutes watched per hour of viewing, by categories of video resolution (using the height of the video in pixels); weighted by the time watched at that resolution</p>
  <p><strong>Video start time</strong> - Average time between the play request and the stream start per video view; this time does not include ad pre-roll time; start time looks to describe how much time the viewer had to wait before video started to play</p>
