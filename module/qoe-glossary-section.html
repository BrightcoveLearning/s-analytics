  <h4>Error rate</h4>
  <p>Percent of all play requests with errors that prevented playback
    experience.</p>
  <p>Errors are often caused by player or player plugin misconfiguration.
    Viewing error rate by device or player can provide direction on where to
    focus on reducing errors. You can review our <a
      href="https://player.support.brightcove.com/references/brightcove-player-error-reference.html">Brightcove
      Player Error Reference</a> for more information on player errors.</p>
  <h4>Video start time</h4>
  <p>Average time between the play request and the stream start per video view;
    this time does not include ad pre-roll time.</p>
  <p>The number of player plugins that load, initial stream bitrate, and viewer
    bandwidth can impact start time.
    Reviewing players, bitrate ladder, and device/video resolution breakdown can
    provide direction on improving this.</p>
  <h4>Video resolution</h4>
  <p>Percent of engagement events issued by categories of video resolution.</p>
  <p>Reviewing resolution breakdown by device in combination with video start
    time, rebuffering time, and stall rate can show ways to optimize playback.</p>
  <h4>Rebuffering time</h4>
  <p>Average seconds of buffering per hour of video viewed.</p>
  <p>This often increases when the bandwidth is too low to consume the bitrate of the stream that is playing.
    Looking at bitrate and video resolution by device or country can provide insights into video resolution adjustments that could reduce rebuffering.</p>
  <h4>Stall Rate</h4>
  <p>Stalls per hours viewed in the time range.</p>
  <p>Stall rates often increase when the bandwidth is too low to consume the bitrate of the stream that is playing.
    Looking at bitrate and video resolution by device or country can both provide insights into video resolution adjustments that could reduce rebuffering.</p>
    <h4>Avg bitrate</h4>
    <p>Average bitrate (kbps) across all video views in the time range.</p>
    <h4>Upscale time</h4>
    <p>Average seconds per hour spent in an upscaled state.</p>
    <p>Upscaling has a real impact on picture clarity when video resolution is significantly lower than screen resolution.
      Review screen resolutions by device to understand the potential impact of upscaling better.
      Consumers using 4K TVs will often have upscaling occur, but the viewing experience can still be high quality.</p>
    <!-- <h4>B</h4>
  <p><strong>Bitrate</strong> - The average bitrate reported by the player accross all sessions in a given period</p>
  <h4>E</h4>
  <p><strong>Error count</strong> - Number of the errors that prevent or interrupt playback or that could impact start/resume time </p>
  <p><strong>Error rate</strong> - The number of sessions with at least one error divided by the number of play requests</p>
  <h4>P</h4>
  <p><strong>Play request</strong> - A play request is counted every time the play button is clicked</p>
  <h4>R</h4>
  <p><strong>Rebuffering time</strong> - Seconds spent rebuffering per hour of watched video</p>
  <p><strong>Rendition switches</strong> - Average number of switches across all sessions</p>
  <h4>S</h4>
  <p><strong>Stall rate</strong> - Total number of stalls divided by the sum of the watch time</p>
  <h4>U</h4>
  <p><strong>Upscale factor</strong> -  The ratio between player resolution and delivered video resolution when the player viewport is bigger than the delivered resolution</p>
  <p><strong>Upscale time</strong> - The average number of seconds per hour of viewing that is spent in an upscaled state; upscaling occurs when a video rendition is streamed in a lower resolution than the current player size</p>
  <h4>V</h4>
  <p><strong>Video resolution</strong> (avg min per hour) - Average minutes watched per hour of viewing, by categories of video resolution (using the height of the video in pixels); weighted by the time watched at that resolution</p>
  <p><strong>Video start time</strong> - Average time between the play request and the stream start per video view; this time does not include ad pre-roll time; start time looks to describe how much time the viewer had to wait before video started to play</p>
  <p><strong>Views</strong> - The number of times a video started playing, recorded when the stream is started (does not include rewind or replay); it is not a measure of individual viewers</p> -->
