    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>To learn about the audience for your Brightcove {{ site.product_short }} apps, you can use Google Analytics. To get you started, Brightcove will load a customized template for Looker Studio into your Google Analytics account.</p>
    <p>Looker Studio, a part of the Google Marketing Platform, is an online tool for visualizing analytics data in customizable reports and dashboards. Looker Studio offers features including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data Visualization</strong> - Create interactive charts, diagrams, and tables</li>
      <li><strong>Integration with Data Sources</strong> - Integrate from different data channels using partner connectors</li>
      <li><strong>Teamwork</strong> - Collaborate by sharing dashboards among team members</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more details, see Google's <a href="https://lookerstudio.google.com/navigation/reporting">Looker Studio</a> homepage.</p>
    

    <!-- <p>Undoubtedly you will want to know what viewers are watching in your Brightcove {{ site.product_short }} apps. To accomplish this you will use Google Analytics. Brightcove will load a customized Dashboard and a customized Google Data Studio report into your Google Analytics account. Both of these tools provide great insight into how your customers are using your Brightcove {{ site.product_short }} apps.</p>
    <p>In addition to the customized dashboard and report, you can use the standard analytics tools in Google Analytics to view customer behavior. You can use the standard analytics data gathered by Google, and in addition Brightcove adds other entities to use, detailed later in this document. For instance, <strong>Movies</strong> events are dispatched when a movie is played, a default Google analytics measure, and time watched is calculated, a measure added by Brightcove. Therefore, in Google Analytics you can see the "most watched" movies by both how many times viewers played the movie and total time watched. These entities added by Brightcove are used extensively in the customized dashboard and report mentioned in the previous paragraph.</p> -->

    <h2 id="Viewing_dimensions_and_metrics">Viewing dimensions and metrics</h2>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip">If you are not familiar with analytics dimensions and metrics here is a VERY simplified explanation:
      <ul>
        <li>Dimensions are attributes of your data. For example, the city where views are coming from is a dimension. A single dimension can contain many values, like the names of all the cities from which you have views.</li>
        <li>Metrics are quantitative measurements. So the number of sessions from a particular city would be a metric.</li>
      </ul>
    </aside>
    <p>Brightcove adds functionality to the default Google measures for your analytics reports. You can use the default Google Analytics dimensions and metrics, the building blocks of analytics reports, as well as numerous dimensions and one metric added by Brightcove. These additional dimensions and the one metric are used in the dashboard and Data Studio report shown in the first two sections of this document.</p>
    <p> Note that the dimensions and metric added by Brightcove are NOT the same for each type of Brightcove {{ site.product_short }} app. For instance, the iOS mobile data has 16 custom dimensions added, whereas the web site app has 20 custom dimensions added. To see a list of the dimensions and metric in the Google Analytics UI, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Log in to <a href="https://analytics.google.com">Google Analytics</a>.</li>
      <li>Click on the accounts dropdown menu to see all your Google Analytics accounts.
